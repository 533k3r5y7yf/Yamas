# Yamas + Spoofa

#### ComaX' Yamas running Spoofa instead of Arpspoof

Arpspoof doesn't work in Kali. This version of Yamas uses <a href= "https://github.com/SilverFoxx/Spoofa" target="_blank" >Spoof</a> instead.

Must have Spoofa installed in your path.

Original Yamas is at: <a href="http://comax.fr/yamas.php" target="_blank" /a>
